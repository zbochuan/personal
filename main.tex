\section{Introduction}
This section introduces the problem statement and outlines the objectives of the project. The design proposal focuses on the MPRC project, where we aim to deliver an optimized solution considering the constraints.

\section{Design Concepts}
\subsection{The First Design Concept Considered}
We considered a variety of design concepts for the MPRC. The first design is inspired by the simplicity of existing engineering solutions and is detailed in this section.

\subsection{The Second Design Concept Considered}
The second concept, as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:concept2}, addresses several challenges by focusing on a modular approach.

\subsubsection{Key Advantages of the Second Design}
This subsection highlights the main advantages of this design and the reasoning behind choosing this concept.

\section{Conclusion}
In conclusion, we presented two design concepts and outlined the rationale for selecting the second option as the most promising.
